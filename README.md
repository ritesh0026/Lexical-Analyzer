# Lexical-Analyzer
Lexical analyzer performs the first phase of compiler i.e. lexical analysis. It takes the modified source code from language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences. The lexical analyzer breaks these these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments in the source code.
